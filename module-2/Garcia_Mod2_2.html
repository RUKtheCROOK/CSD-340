        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        <p class="intro">My name is John Garcia. <span class="sentence">I currently live in North Platte Nebraska but plan to move to Bellevue sometime in the near future.</span> I have a small family that consists of a dog and my wife, Megan.</p>
        <p>My days are very simple becuase I tend to keep busy. I attend Bellevue University in an effort to gain a bachelors degree in software development. When I am not doing that I am either working, playing video games, reading, at the gym, or spending time with my family.</p>
        <p>I used to be in the United States Air Force as a Space Systems Operator and a Mission Planner. Now I work in the software field as a full time Software Developer for a large company based out of plano texas. I am still a junior but have been really enjoying the world of software so far.</p>
        <p>Like I mentioned above, I am planning on making a move to Bellevue Nebraska soon. I may end up in an area nearby, like Papillion, as well. It would be the second time I left North Platte, but this time it would be my choice, and not the governments choice, so I am pretty excited this time around.</p>
